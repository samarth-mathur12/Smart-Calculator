# 📐 Smart Calculator — Calc-U
A simple smart calculator built with Python and Tkinter that understands basic math operations from text input!


## ✨ Features
- Perform Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Modulus operations.

- Accepts text input like:
```bash
5 plus 10
15 divided by 3
8 * 4
20 mod 3
```
- Friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI).
- Easy to extend with more operations (LCM, HCF placeholders included).

## 🗂️ Project Structure
```bash
smart_calculator/
│
├── main.py   # Main calculator script
├── main_test.py  # Unit test case script
├── README.md             # This file
```


## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository (or copy the script to your machine):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samarth-mathur12/Smart-Calculator.git
cd Smart-Calculator
```
2. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).
3. Run the script:
```bash
python smart_calculator.py
```
4. Use the GUI:
Type a math expression in words or symbols (e.g., 10 plus 5).
Click "Just this" to see the result.
